    <div class="col-6 content">
      <b>Data Center (DC)</b><br>
        is the facility that houses the servers, storage devices, network elements, security devices, and other AWS infrastructure.  No AWS DC is "cold".  All devices are ODM - Original Design Manufacturer, which is custom for AWS. AWS even uses their own network protocol stack. <br>
      <b>Availability Zone (AZ)</b><br>
      made up of one or more DCs, exist within a region, are representations of physically seperated data centers with low latency, private links between them.  Designed for fault isolation and no single points of failure.  All AZs are connected with redundant links to multiple Tier-1 transit providers.<br>
      <b>Regions</b><br>
      geographical areas where Amazon data centers are located and represents the georgraphical location of where the data will reside.  Made up of two or more AZs.  Communication between regions uses the AWS backbone, a private global network.  The public regions are listed in the console, then there are private regions (e.g. US GovCloud) and local regions (e.g. Asia Pacific Osaka that are not listed.  <br>
      As of June 2018, there are 18 regions worldwide and 55 AZs.  There are 4 new regions and 12 AZs that are announced. <br>
      <b>Edge Locations</b><br>
      AWS has 107 Points of Presence (PoPs)<br>
      96 Edge Locations and 11 Regional Edge Caches in 55 cities across 24 countries <br>
      These are used for Route53 and CloudFront<br>
      Edge Locations is NOT equivalent to a region or an AZ<br>

        AWS is responsible for:<br>
          1. Physical security of DCs<br>
          2. Hardware infrastructure: servers and storage (including decommissioning storage disks)<br>
          3. Software infrastructure: host OS, service apps, virtualization isolation<br>
          4. Network infrastructure: routers, switches, LBs, FWs, network monitoring at external boundaries, intrusion detection<br>
        You are responsible for<br>
          1. Instance OS including patching and maintenance<br>
          2. Application security and access<br>
          3. Security groups<br>

        Virtual computing environment (instances) that you can launch and manage from a GUI or from CLI code<br>
        Supports most OS (Windows, RedHat, SUSE, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux)<br>
        Instances are scalable and optimizable<br>
        Consider the following before you create: core count, memory size, storage size and type, network performance, and CPU architecture<br><br>

        <b>Pricing Models</b><br>
        1. On-demand: pay as you go compute resources. Low cost, flexible.<br>
        2. Spot instances: bidding on instances based on supply/demand, pay the price per instance-hour set at the start of each instance-hour for the entire hour (spot price).  Gives 2 minute prior notification before stopping an instance for someone with a higher bid.  Good for large scale, dynamic workloads.<br>
        3. Reserved instances: full upfront, partial upfront, and no upfront payment options for 1 and 3 	year contract durations.  Good to predict costs and know available capacity needed.<br>
        4. Dedicated Host: you rent the underlying hardware, single-tenancy model, pay hourly, can be upto 75% cheaper than on-demand.  You can control licensing. Good for compliance and regulatory requirements.<br><br>

        Per Second Billing: minimum increment is 60 seconds, so even if you run for 10 seconds, you will be charged for 60<br>
        Available for On-Demand, Reserved, Spot instances, all regions and AZs, only on Amazon Linux and Ubuntu.  Everything else is per-hour.<br><br>

        Reserved Instances are just a billing scheme. You can purchase at Region Level or at AZ level; regional level is better because if you buy an xlarge instance then you can run 2 large ones.<br>
        Also can do a "Scheduled" Reserve i.e. 1 year reserved, compute between 01:00 and 03:00.  Halfway towards serverless.  <br>
        You can re-sell your instances in the AWS marketplace if you don't need them anymore but the contract didn't expire. <br>
        And You can upgrade your reserved host model.<br><br>

        Spot instance hibernation: You can basically pause an EBS backed instance, resumed by the Spot service when your defined max price is less than the Spot price. <br>
        Crucial to have a hybernation agent and to have an encrypted Root volume.  <br>
        Instance memory is stored on the root volume when hybernated.<br><br>

        Enhanced Networking: currently supported using SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization). <br>
        SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization compared to traditional implementations.
        <br>For supported Amazon EC2 instances, this feature provides higher packet per second (PPS) performance, lower inter-instance latencies, and very low network jitter.

            Within a VPC there are multiple subnets that technically map to the AZ'swithin the region.   <br>
            For example, the North Virginia region has 6 AZ's and a default VPC with 6 subnets.  You can create new subnets and assign them to be public or private.  The default subnet inside a VPC is publicly accessible.<br><br>
            You configure the following within a VPC:<br>
            1. IP Subnets<br>
            2. Routing tables <br>
            3. Gateways<br>
            4. Security settings<br>

                    A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed. <br>
                    Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table; the table controls the routing for the subnet. A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time, but you can associate multiple subnets with the same route table. <br>
                    You cannot delete the main route table, but you can replace the main route table with a custom table that you've created.<br>
                    Every route table contains a local route for communication within the VPC <br>

              ELB - Elastic Load Balancer
          </div>
          <div class="col-6 content">
            A regional specific object that accepts incoming traffic from clients and routes requests to its registered targets (EC2 instances) in one or more AZs.<br>
            You select the AZs when configuring the ELB and AWS will deploy the service in each subnet selected.  You can only select one subnet within an AZ to have the ELB.<br>
            The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy targets. When the load balancer detects an unhealthy target, it stops routing traffic to that target, and then resumes routing traffic to that target when it detects that the target is healthy again.<br>
            Listener processes check for connection requests based on port and protocol (e.g. HTTP:80, or HTTP:8080)<br>
            An ELB is referenced by its DNS name.  You should use an A Alias to map your own name to it.<br>
            Within an ELB, an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is created that points to an EC2 instance.  You configure the instances across AZ's and the ELB can effectively ensure High Availability of your instances.<br>
            A Target Group is an instance resource pool; a  logical clustering of instances that serve the same purpose<br><br>
            <img src="media/lb.png"><br><br>
            Cross-zone LB: traffic is distrubuted across registered targets in ALL AZs, enabled by default on APL, disabled on NLB.  If disabled, each LB will only sent traffic to its own AZs.<br>
            Security Group: The rules for the security groups associated with your load balancer security group must allow traffic in both directions on both the listener and the health check ports. Whenever you add a listener to a load balancer or update the health check port for a target group, you must review your security group rules to ensure that they allow traffic on the new port in both directions.<br>
            Connection Draining: wait until sessions are completed before allowing an instance to de-register from a resouce pool
            <br>Can be enabled through the console, API, CLI, or CloudFormation
            <br><b>Features that distinguish ELB from Route53</b><br>
            1. HA and scalability is automatically handled by AWS<br>
            2. Can be configued along with Security Groups for tighter security<br>
            3. Health Checks can be used to maintain status of instances, and traffic is only routed to healthy targets<br>
            4. SSL Offloading: the LB will handle HTTP<-->HTTPS translation and encryption instead of the browser or the server><br>
            5. Sticky Sessions: Using Cookies to control the user experience, or using TTL for duration based sessions <br>
            6. Proxy Protocol: acts as a transparent proxy, so the user-data (source IP, etc..) can be sent to the instance<br>
            7. Works over L4 or L7<br><br>
            Limit: 20 ELBs per region, 5 SGs per ELB

            <b>Application Load Balancer</b><br>
            Works at Application Layer, can read the URI in the Request (Layer 7), advanced load balancing of HTTP/S traffic and containers<br>
            Benefits:<br>
            Supports path-based routing (based on the URL of the request)<br>
            Host-based routing (in the HTTP request header, to route traffic to multiple domains using a single ELB)<br>
            Can route to multiple applications on a single instance (port based routing)<br>
            Health checks are defined at Target Group level, so CloudWatch metrics are more refined, and you can use ASG to scale dynamically at service level<br>
            Has verbose and compressed access logs<br><br>
            <b>Network Load Balancer</b><br>
            Makes decisions based on TCP/IP Layer (Layer 4)<br>
            Benefits:<br>
            Can handle millions of requests per second at extremely low latencies<br>
            You can assign a static IP to the ELB<br>
            You can register targets that are outside of the VPC<br>
            Can also route to multiple applications on a single instance (port based routing)<br>

            Sometimes you'll get an HTTP:503 Service Unavailable or HTTP:504 Gateway Timeout errors so you gotta refer to CloudWatch to make sure the ELB is processing requests.<br>
            Check for the following CloudWatch metrics:<br>
              1. SurgeQueueLength<br>
              Surge queue length is defined by the number of requests that are queued by Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). These requests are queued when back-end systems are unable to process incoming requests as fast as the requests are being received<br>
              2. SpilloverCount<br>
              When the max SurgeQueueLength is exceeded, the sum statistic of the SpilloverCount metric begins to measure the total number of requests that were rejected due to the queue being full<br>
            These errors happen if and when you have:<br>
            1. Overloaded target instances that can't handles your requests due to CPU/Memory/Network limitations<br>
            2. Application dependencies are not being met in time (external data sources outside of your instance or not responding in time)<br>
            3. Max connections reached on the web servers and can't process new requests<br>
            The solution is to always monitor you CloudWatch logs, refine your web server configs, use ASG to scale out, or scale up your instance type.

              A CDN service to deliver access to high bandwidth content from sources closer to the user and thereby saves on bandwidth to the origin servers.<br>

              Akamai call Edge Servers as ‘Surrogates’<br>
              Inherently protects against DDoS (for app stress testing you need special approvals from AWS support team)<br>

              Typically, CloudFront serves an object from an edge location until the cache duration that you specified passes—that is, until the object expires. After it expires, the next time the edge location gets a user request for the object, CloudFront forwards the request to the origin server to verify that the cache contains the latest version of the object. <br>
              The response from the origin depends on whether the object has changed: <br>
              If the CloudFront cache already has the latest version, the origin returns a 304 status code (Not Modified). <br>
              If the CloudFront cache does not have the latest version, the origin returns a 200 status code (OK) and the latest version of the object. <br>
              <br>If an object in an edge location isn't frequently requested, CloudFront might evict the object—remove the object before its expiration date—to make room for objects that have been requested more recently.
            <br>  By default, each object automatically expires after 24 hours. For web distributions, you can change the default behavior in two ways:
            <br>  -TTL of all objects at the same time
            <br>  -TTL of objects individually
