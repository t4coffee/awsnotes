    <div class="col-9 content">
      <b>Data Center (DC)</b><br>
        is the facility that houses the servers, storage devices, network elements, security devices, and other AWS infrastructure.  No AWS DC is "cold".  All devices are ODM - Original Design Manufacturer, which is custom for AWS. AWS even uses their own network protocol stack. <br>
      <b>Availability Zone (AZ)</b><br>
      made up of one or more DCs, exist within a region, are representations of physically seperated data centers with low latency, private links between them.  Designed for fault isolation and no single points of failure.  All AZs are connected with redundant links to multiple Tier-1 transit providers.<br>
      <b>Regions</b><br>
      geographical areas where Amazon data centers are located and represents the georgraphical location of where the data will reside.  Made up of two or more AZs.  Communication between regions uses the AWS backbone, a private global network.  The public regions are listed in the console, then there are private regions (e.g. US GovCloud) and local regions (e.g. Asia Pacific Osaka that are not listed.  <br>
      As of June 2018, there are 18 regions worldwide and 55 AZs.  There are 4 new regions and 12 AZs that are announced. <br>
      <b>Edge Locations</b><br>
      AWS has 107 Points of Presence (PoPs)<br>
      96 Edge Locations and 11 Regional Edge Caches in 55 cities across 24 countries <br>
      These are used for Route53 and CloudFront<br>
      Edge Locations is NOT equivalent to a region or an AZ<br>

        EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute
      </div>
      <div class="col-9 content">
        Virtual computing environment (instances) that you can launch and manage from a GUI or from CLI code, runs on the XEN hypervisor<br>
        Supports most OS (Windows, RedHat, SUSE, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux)<br>
        Instances are scalable and optimizable<br>
        Consider the following before you create: core count, memory size, storage size and type, network performance, and CPU architecture<br><br>

        <b>Pricing Models</b><br>
        1. On-demand: pay as you go compute resources. Low cost, flexible.<br>
        2. Spot instances: bidding on instances based on supply/demand, pay the price per instance-hour set at the start of each instance-hour for the entire hour (spot price).  Gives 2 minute prior notification before stopping an instance for someone with a higher bid.  Good for large scale, dynamic workloads.<br>
        3. Reserved instances: full upfront, partial upfront, and no upfront payment options for 1 and 3 	year contract durations.  Good to predict costs and know available capacity needed.<br>
        4. Dedicated Host: you rent the underlying hardware, single-tenancy model, pay hourly, can be upto 75% cheaper than on-demand.  You can control licensing. Good for compliance and regulatory requirements.<br><br>
<br>
        You can launch or start instances in a placement group, which determines how instances are placed on underlying hardware.<br>
        <b>Cluster</b><br>
        -Clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone<br>
        -Cluster placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both, and if the majority of the network traffic is between the instances in the group. <br>
        -To provide the lowest latency and the highest packet-per-second network performance for your placement group, choose an instance type that supports enhanced networking<br>
        <b>Spread</b><br>
        -Spreads instances across underlying hardware<br>
        -Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other. <br>
        -Launching instances in a spread placement group reduces the risk of simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share the same underlying hardware. <br>
        -Spread placement groups provide access to distinct hardware, and are therefore suitable for mixing instance types or launching instances over time.<br>
        -A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones, and you can have a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group.

        Billing

        Per Second Billing: minimum increment is 60 seconds, so even if you run for 10 seconds, you will be charged for 60<br>
        Available for On-Demand, Reserved, Spot instances, all regions and AZs, only on Amazon Linux and Ubuntu.  Everything else is per-hour.<br>

        Spot Instances: You pay the Spot price that’s in effect at the beginning of each instance-hour for your running instance. If Spot price changes after you launch the instance, the new price is charged against the instance usage for the subsequent hour. <br>
        Defined Duration Spot Instance: 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 hours at an hourly rate set when you provision this, you are billed at this price for each hour or partial hour that the instance is running. A partial instance hour is billed to the nearest second. <br>

        Reserved Instances are just a billing scheme. You can purchase at Region Level or at AZ level; regional level is better because if you buy an xlarge instance then you can run 2 large ones.<br>
        Also can do a "Scheduled" Reserve i.e. 1 year reserved, compute between 01:00 and 03:00.  Halfway towards serverless.  <br>
        You can re-sell your instances in the AWS marketplace if you don't need them anymore but the contract didn't expire. <br>
        And You can upgrade your reserved host model.<br><br>

        Spot instance hibernation: You can specify the Spot service to pause an EBS backed instance, to be resumed only by the Spot service when your defined max price is less than the Spot price. <br>
        Crucial to have a hybernation agent and to have an encrypted Root volume.  <br>
        Instance memory is stored on the root volume when hybernated.<br><br>

        The following are the possible reasons that Amazon EC2 will interrupt your Spot Instances: <br>
        Price – The Spot price is greater than your maximum price. <br>
        Capacity – If there are not enough unused EC2 instances to meet the demand for Spot Instances, Amazon EC2 interrupts Spot Instances. The order in which the instances are interrupted is determined by Amazon EC2. <br>
        Constraints – If your request includes a constraint such as a launch group or an Availability Zone group, these Spot Instances are terminated as a group when the constraint can no longer be met. <br>
        An On-Demand Instance specified in a Spot Fleet cannot be interrupted. <br> <br>

        Enhanced Networking: currently supported using SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization). <br>
        SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization compared to traditional implementations.
        <br>For supported Amazon EC2 instances, this feature provides higher packet per second (PPS) performance, lower inter-instance latencies, and very low network jitter.

            VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
          </div>
          <div class="col-9 content">
            Regional level object<br>
            A comprehensive set of virtual networking capabilities that allow customers to provision logically isolated virtual network to host AWS resources.  <br>
            You can create multiple VPCs within the same region and you can include resources in more than one AZ withing a single VPC<br>
            You can connect VPCs in different regions to each other without going through the Public Internet<br>
            Instances within a VPC will all have private IP addresses<br>
            You can only attach ONE internet gateway to your VPC<br>
<br>
            Within a VPC there are multiple subnets that technically map to the AZ'swithin the region.   <br>
            A subnet cannot span multiple AZs, each subnet is unique within its own AZ <br>
            For example, the North Virginia region has 6 AZ's and a default VPC with 6 subnets.  You can create new subnets and assign them to be public or private.  The default subnet inside a VPC is publicly accessible.<br><br>
  <br>
            <b>Subnets</b><br>
            When you create a subnet, you assign a CIDR block, AWS reserves both the first four and the last IPv4 address in each subnet's CIDR block. They're not available for use. <br>
            The smallest subnet you can create is a /28, and the largest is a /16<br>
            The public IP address for your instance is released when it's stopped or terminated. The stopped instance receives a new public IP address when it's restarted.   <br>
            These Public IP's are NAT'd, for persistent public IP, use EIP<br>

<br>
            You configure the following within a VPC:<br>
            1. IP Subnets<br>
            2. Routing tables <br>
            3. Gateways<br>
            4. Security settings<br>
            <br>
            When creating a custom VPC, the following is created automatically:<br>
            1. Route Table<br>
            2. Security Group <br>
            3. Access Control List (ACL)<br>
            <br>
            <img src="media/vpc.png">
            <br><br>
            <b> VPC Endpoints </b><br>
            A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. <br>
            Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.
            <br><br>
            <b> VPC Flow Logs </b><br>
            A a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. <br>
            Flow log data is stored using Amazon CloudWatch Logs. After you've created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. <br>
            You can create upto 2 flow logs for a VPC, a subnet, or a network interface. <br>
            <br>
            Limit: 5 VPC per region.

            Once established, traffic will flow between peer VPCs using private IP addresses<br>

                  <div class="col-9 content">
                    A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed. <br>
                    Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table; the table controls the routing for the subnet. A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time, but you can associate multiple subnets with the same route table. <br>
                    You cannot delete the main route table, but you can replace the main route table with a custom table that you've created.<br>
                    Every route table contains a local route for communication within the VPC <br>
                    By default, new subnets in a custom VPC can communicate with each other across Availability Zones.

              ELB - Elastic Load Balancer
          </div>
          <div class="col-9 content">
            A regional specific object that accepts incoming traffic from clients and routes requests to its registered targets (EC2 instances) in one or more AZs.<br>
            You select the AZs when configuring the ELB and AWS will deploy the service in each subnet selected.  You can only select one subnet within an AZ to have the ELB.<br>
            The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy targets. <br>
            When the load balancer detects an unhealthy target, it stops routing traffic to that target, and then resumes routing traffic to that target when it detects that the target is healthy again.<br>
            Listener processes check for connection requests based on port and protocol (e.g. HTTP:80, or HTTP:8080)<br>
<br>
            An ELB is referenced by its DNS name.  You should use an A Alias to map your own name to it.<br>
<br>
            Within an ELB, an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is created that points to an EC2 instance.  You configure the instances across AZ's and the ELB can effectively ensure High Availability of your instances.<br>
            <br>
            A Target Group is an instance resource pool; a  logical clustering of instances that serve the same purpose<br><br>
            <img src="media/lb.png"><br><br>
            Cross-zone LB: traffic is distrubuted across registered targets in ALL AZs, enabled by default on APL, disabled on NLB.  If disabled, each LB will only sent traffic to its own AZs.<br>
            <br>
            Security Group: The rules for the security groups associated with your load balancer security group must allow traffic in both directions on both the listener and the health check ports. <br>
            Whenever you add a listener to a load balancer or update the health check port for a target group, you must review your security group rules to ensure that they allow traffic on the new port in both directions.<br>
  <br>
            Connection Draining: wait until sessions are completed before allowing an instance to de-register from a resouce pool
            <br>Can be enabled through the console, API, CLI, or CloudFormation
<br>
            <br><b>Features that distinguish ELB from Route53</b><br>
            1. HA and scalability is automatically handled by AWS<br>
            2. Can be configued along with Security Groups for tighter security<br>
            3. Health Checks can be used to maintain status of instances, and traffic is only routed to healthy targets<br>
            4. SSL Offloading: the LB will handle HTTP<-->HTTPS translation and encryption instead of the browser or the server><br>
            5. Sticky Sessions: Using Cookies to control the user experience, or using TTL for duration based sessions <br>
            6. Proxy Protocol: acts as a transparent proxy, so the user-data (source IP, etc..) can be sent to the instance<br>
            7. Works over L4 or L7<br><br>
            Limit: 20 ELBs per region, 5 SGs per ELB

            Works at Application Layer, can read the URI in the Request (Layer 7), advanced load balancing of HTTP/S traffic and containers<br>
            Must be deployed in at-least two subnets<br>
            Benefits:<br>
            Supports path-based routing (based on the URL of the request)<br>
            Host-based routing (in the HTTP request header, to route traffic to multiple domains using a single ELB)<br>
            Can route to multiple applications on a single instance (port based routing)<br>
            Health checks are defined at Target Group level, so CloudWatch metrics are more refined, and you can use ASG to scale dynamically at service level<br>
            Has verbose and compressed access logs<br><br>
            <b>Network Load Balancer</b><br>
            Makes decisions based on TCP/IP Layer (Layer 4)<br>
            Benefits:<br>
            Can handle millions of requests per second at extremely low latencies<br>
            You can assign a static IP to the ELB<br>
            You can register targets that are outside of the VPC<br>
            Can also route to multiple applications on a single instance (port based routing)<br>

            Sometimes you'll get an HTTP:503 Service Unavailable or HTTP:504 Gateway Timeout errors so you gotta refer to CloudWatch to make sure the ELB is processing requests.<br>
            Check for the following CloudWatch metrics:<br>
              1. SurgeQueueLength<br>
              Surge queue length is defined by the number of requests that are queued by Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). <br>
              These requests are queued when back-end systems are unable to process incoming requests as fast as the requests are being received<br>
              2. SpilloverCount<br>
              When the max SurgeQueueLength is exceeded, the sum statistic of the SpilloverCount metric begins to measure the total number of requests that were rejected due to the queue being full<br>
              <br>
            These errors happen if and when you have:<br>
            1. Overloaded target instances that can't handles your requests due to CPU/Memory/Network limitations<br>
            2. Application dependencies are not being met in time (external data sources outside of your instance or not responding in time)<br>
            3. Max connections reached on the web servers and can't process new requests<br>
            The solution is to always monitor you CloudWatch logs, refine your web server configs, use ASG to scale out, or scale up your instance type.

              A CDN service to deliver access to high bandwidth content from sources closer to the user and thereby saves on bandwidth to the origin servers.<br>

              Akamai call Edge Servers as ‘Surrogates’<br>
              Inherently protects against DDoS (for app stress testing you need special approvals from AWS support team)<br>
<br>
              Typically, CloudFront serves an object from an edge location until the cache duration that you specified passes—that is, until the object expires. <br>
              After it expires, the next time the edge location gets a user request for the object, CloudFront forwards the request to the origin server to verify that the cache contains the latest version of the object. <br>
<br>
              The response from the origin depends on whether the object has changed: <br>
              If the CloudFront cache already has the latest version, the origin returns a 304 status code (Not Modified). <br>
              If the CloudFront cache does not have the latest version, the origin returns a 200 status code (OK) and the latest version of the object. <br>
              <br>If an object in an edge location isn't frequently requested, CloudFront might evict the object—remove the object before its expiration date—to make room for objects that have been requested more recently.
            <br>  By default, each object automatically expires after 24 hours. For web distributions, you can change the default behavior in two ways:
            <br>  -TTL of all objects at the same time
            <br>  -TTL of objects individually

      <div class="col-9 content">
        AZ level object <br>
        Directly attached to one EC2 instance at a time and offers low latency between instance and volume<br>
        Compared to instance storage which resides directly on the EC2 and is ephemeral (gets deleted when instance shutsdown/reboots)<br>
        Supports a Root Volume (location of the OS)<br>
        Capacity of volume has to be provisioned upon instance creation<br>
        Data is automatically replicated across multiple DC's within the same AZ and can be backed up to S3<br>

        <b>Use Cases:</b><br>
        Boot volumes and storage for EC2<br>
        Data storage of a file system<br>
        Database hosts<br>
        Enterprise applications<br>

        <b>EBS types:</b> <br>
        1. General Purpose (gp2) - SSD<br>
        For boot volumes, VDI, dev/test, low-latency interactive apps<br>
        Gp2 volumes support up to 10,000 IOPS and 160 MB/s of throughput<br>
        2. Provisioned IOPS (io1) - SSD<br>
        For I/O intensive workloads, RDS, NoSQL<br>
        Io1 volumes support up to 32,000 IOPS and 500 MB/s of throughput<br>
        3. Throughput Optimized (st1) - HDD<br>
        Streaming services, big data, data warehouse, log processing, cannot be a boot volume<br>
        4. Cold (sc1) - HDD<br>

        5. Magnetic disk (standard) <br>
        <br>
        Snapshots<br>
        You can back up the data on your Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon S3 by taking point-in-time snapshots. <br>
        Snapshots are incremental backups, which means that only the blocks on the device that have changed after your most recent snapshot are saved. This minimizes the time required to create the snapshot and saves on storage costs by not duplicating data. <br>
        When you delete a snapshot, only the data unique to that snapshot is removed.<br>
        Each snapshot contains all of the information needed to restore your data (from the moment when the snapshot was taken) to a new EBS volume. <br>
        <br>Incremental snapshot<br>
        <img src="media/ebsincrem.png"><br><br>
        EBS snapshots broadly support EBS encryption.<br>
        Snapshots of encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted.<br>
        Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are automatically encrypted.<br>
        When you copy an unencrypted snapshot that you own, you can encrypt it during the copy process.<br>
        When you copy an encrypted snapshot that you own, you can reencrypt it with a different key during the copy process.<br><br>

<br>
            Amazon RDS provides two different methods for backing up and restoring your DB instance(s) automated backups and database snapshots (DB Snapshots).<br>
            When automated backups are turned on for your DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically performs a full daily snapshot of your data (during your preferred backup window) and captures transaction logs (as updates to your DB Instance are made).<br>
            Retention Period: by default 7 days, max up to 35 days.<br>
            DB Snapshots are user-initiated and enable you to back up your DB instance in a known state as frequently as you wish, and then restore to that specific state at any time. <br>
<br>
              <b>Optimization Techniques:</b><br>
              1. Elastic Cache<br>
              Caching layer for DB’s where developers have to code the function to move data to cache and that it is serving requests, it is not an automatic service<br>
              Memcached and Redis engines<br>
              2. Read Replica<br>
              A DB with another DNS name for only READ data<br>
              Can be in another AZ or Region<br>
              Needs sync with PRIMARY DB<br>
              Sync latency of Aurora is 60ms<br>
              Use cases: data warehouse, DB migrations (create RR, point requests there, migrate 	PRIMARY, sync, revert DNS pointer<br>
              3. Elastic Load Balancer<br>
              4. Scale Up DB instance<br>
              5. Sharding: split data into multiple DB's to increase query efficiency, highly depends on schema structure<br>
<br>
              <b>Multi-AZ Deployment</b><br>
              An availability measure, and NOT a performance improvement measure <br>
              Achieve HA by replicating across multiple AZ's manually, AWS does Master/Secondary asynchronous replication for you after you set it up<br>
              Multi-AZ deployments utilize synchronous replication, making database writes concurrently on both the primary and standby so that the standby will be up-to-date in the event a failover occurs.<br>
              While our technological implementation for Multi-AZ DB Instances maximizes data durability in failure scenarios, it precludes the standby from being accessed directly or used for read operations.<br>
              The fault tolerance offered by Multi-AZ deployments make them a natural fit for production environments.<br>

              <b>Read Replicas</b><br>
              For read-heavy database workloads<br>
              Once the Read Replica is created, database updates on the source DB instance will be propagated to the Read Replica. <br>
              You can create multiple Read Replicas for a given source DB Instance and distribute your application’s read traffic amongst them.<br>
              Supported by Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL; use each's built-in replication technology and are subject to its strengths and limitations<br>
              Updates are applied to your Read Replica(s) after they occur on the source DB instance (“asynchronous” replication), and replication lag can vary significantly.<br>
              This means recent database updates made to a standard (non Multi-AZ) source DB instance may not be present on associated Read Replicas in the event of an unplanned outage on the source DB instance. <br>
              As such, Read Replicas do not offer the same data durability benefits as Multi-AZ deployments. <br>
              While Read Replicas can provide some read availability benefits, they and are not designed to improve write availability.

              DynamoDB allocates additional partitions to a table in the following situations:<br>
              1. If you increase the table's provisioned throughput settings beyond what the existing partitions can support.<br>
              2. If an existing partition fills to capacity and more storage space is required.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Provisioned Throughput</b><br>
              Read Capacity: EVENTUAL and STRONG CONSISTENCY options for items as large as 4KB<br>
              -> eventual has better throughput but may not reflect latest written data<br>
              -> strong ensures that all data read is at the latest version but at the cost of throughput<br>
              Write Capacity: one write per second for items as large as 1KB<br>
<br>
              Data defined as Document or as Item:Attribute key-value pairs (YAML/JSON format)<br>
              1. Partition Key - for single attributes<br>
              2. Partition Key and Sort Key for multiple attributes<br>
              All keys are unique<br>
              Any "Query" needs a Partition Key, if you don't and use a SCAN function you will impact the throughput of your DB<br><br>
              <b>Sample DynamoDB Table </b><br><img src="media/dyno.png"><br>
<br>
              <b>DynamoDB table with only a partition key </b><br><img src="media/dynpart.png"><br>
              To write an item to the table, DynamoDB uses the value of the partition key as input to an internal hash function. The output value from the hash function determines the partition in which the item will be stored.<br>
              To read an item from the table, you must specify the partition key value for the item. DynamoDB uses this value as input to its hash function, yielding the partition in which the item can be found.<br>
<br>
              <b>DynamoDB table with partition and sort keys</b> <br><img src="media/dynsort.png"><br>
              To write an item to the table, DynamoDB calculates the hash value of the partition key to determine which partition should contain the item. In that partition, there could be several items with the same partition key value, so DynamoDB stores all of the items with the same partition key value physically close together, in ascending order by sort key.<br>
              To read an item from the table, you must specify its partition key value and sort key value. DynamoDB calculates the partition key's hash value, yielding the partition in which the item can be found.<br>
              You can read multiple items from the table in a single operation (Query), provided that the items you want have the same partition key value. DynamoDB returns all of the items with that partition key value. <br>
              Optionally, you can apply a condition to the sort key so that it returns only the items within a certain range of values. <br>

<br>
              Re-Indexing<br>
              1. Global Secondary Index: can change partition and sort keys<br>
              2. Local Secondary Index: can change sort key only, only done during creation of DB table<br>
<br>
              Stream: captures all changes done to a table in 24 hours<br>
              Global Tables: enable cross-region replication, needs same partition keys, and Stream enables on both sides<br>

              ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to set up, manage, and scale a distributed in-memory data store or cache environment in the cloud. <br>
              It provides a high-performance, scalable, and cost-effective caching solution, while removing the complexity associated with deploying and managing a distributed cache environment<br>
              Your applications simply need information about the host names and port numbers of the ElastiCache nodes that you have deployed.<br>
              <b>Benefits:</b><br>
              - Decreases access latency<br>

                    <div class="col-9 content">
                      The first AWS service<br>

                      High throughput service<br>
                      Data is replicated over many servers while in the queue<br>
                      Can also use SSE<br>
                      Has a Producer engine and a Consumer enginer<br>
                      Once a message is consumed, a VISIBILITY TIMER starts where a consumer has to write the message in the DB and issue a DELETE request for the msg from the queue before the timer completes<br>
<br>
                      SQS is a Best Effort service, does not support FIFO because messages are stored in distributed servers<br>
                      -> AWS guarentees that messages will be delivered "at least once"<br>
                      -> the application has to ensure that duplicated are deleted and messages are in order<br>
<br>
                      If the message is corrupted and can't be pulled by the consumer, then the visibility timer expires, after it expires 5 times then the message is sent to a DEAD LETTER QUEUE<br>
<br>
                      Short Polling: constant polling by consumers<br>
                      Long Polling: 20 seconds then close the TCP connection<br>
                      Visibility Timer: default is 30 seconds, max is 12 hours<br>
                      Queue: messages kept by default for 4 days, max 14 days<br>
                      DelayQueue: postpone the delivery of new messages to a queue for a number of seconds, min is 0 seconds, max is 15 minutes.
                      If your SQS is not used within 30 days, AWS will delete it<br>
<br>
                      SQS uses a "weighted random distribution algorithm" to select a group of servers to query for messages, sometimes these set of servers don't contain all the messages that you need so you will get back incomplete data

              Resource Groups
            </div>
            <div class="col-9 content">
              A resource group is a collection of AWS resources that are all in the same AWS region, that match criteria provided in a query, and that share one or more tags or portions of tags.  <br>
              You use a single page to view and manage your resources. <br>
              You build queries in the Resource Groups console or pass them as arguments to Resource Groups commands in the AWS CLI.  <br>
              Queries include lists of resources that are specified in the following format AWS::service::resource, and tags.  <br>
              Tags are keys that help identify and sort your resources within your organization. Optionally, tags include values for keys. <br>
              Resource groups can be nested; a resource group can contain existing resource groups in the same region. <br>
              By default, the AWS Management Console is organized by AWS service. But with Resource Groups, you can create a custom console that organizes and consolidates information based on criteria that you specify in tags.<br>
              Permissions are at the account level. As long as users who are sharing your account have the correct IAM permissions, they can work with resource groups that you create.

              DB's can be used in active/standby config across two AZs<br>
              Applications like Cassandra or MongoDB can achieve HA over two AZ<br>

                Option 1: VPN Connection between on prem and VPC-Virtual Gateway<br>
              -On-Prem: "Customer Gatway" like a Cisco ISR that creates a tunnel using IKE or IPSec<br>
              -VPC: Instance with Software VPN launched from the marketplace<br><br>
              Option 2: Direct Connect<br>
              Private network connection between AWS and your DC<br>
              Good for hybrid cloud, improved app performance, transfering large data sets, security, and compliance. <br>
              Alternative to IPSec VPN.  <br>
              Supports BGP peering.  <br>
              Requires telecom partner to provision the circuit.<br>
              Provides 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps connections, and you can easily provision multiple connections if you need more capacity. <br>
              You can also use AWS Direct Connect instead of establishing a VPN connection over the Internet to your Amazon VPC, avoiding the need to utilize VPN hardware that frequently can’t support data transfer rates above 4 Gbps
