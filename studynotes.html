      Global Infrastructure
    </div>
    <div class="col-6 content">
      <b>Data Center (DC)</b><br>
        is the facility that houses the servers, storage devices, network elements, security devices, and other AWS infrastructure.  No AWS DC is "cold".  All devices are ODM - Original Design Manufacturer, which is custom for AWS. AWS even uses their own network protocol stack. <br>
      <b>Availability Zone (AZ)</b><br>
      made up of one or more DCs, exist within a region, are representations of physically seperated data centers with low latency, private links between them.  Designed for fault isolation and no single points of failure.  All AZs are connected with redundant links to multiple Tier-1 transit providers.<br>
      <b>Regions</b><br>
      geographical areas where Amazon data centers are located and represents the georgraphical location of where the data will reside.  Made up of two or more AZs.  Communication between regions uses the AWS backbone, a private global network.  The public regions are listed in the console, then there are private regions (e.g. US GovCloud) and local regions (e.g. Asia Pacific Osaka that are not listed.  <br>
      As of June 2018, there are 18 regions worldwide and 55 AZs.  There are 4 new regions and 12 AZs that are announced. <br>
      <b>Edge Locations</b><br>
      AWS has 107 Points of Presence (PoPs)<br>
      96 Edge Locations and 11 Regional Edge Caches in 55 cities across 24 countries <br>
      These are used for Route53 and CloudFront<br>
      Edge Locations is NOT equivalent to a region or an AZ<br>

        You have AWS Global Infrastructure (Regions, AZs, Edge Locations) and Foundation Services (Compute, Storage, Database, Networking) at your disposal<br><br>
        AWS is responsible for:<br>
          1. Physical security of DCs<br>
          2. Hardware infrastructure: servers and storage (including decommissioning storage disks)<br>
          3. Software infrastructure: host OS, service apps, virtualization isolation<br>
          4. Network infrastructure: routers, switches, LBs, FWs, network monitoring at external boundaries, intrusion detection<br>
        You are responsible for<br>
          1. Instance OS including patching and maintenance<br>
          2. Application security and access<br>
          3. Security groups<br>
          4. OS/Instance firewalls including IDS and IPS<br>
          5. Network configuration (of VPC)<br>
          6. Account management and seperation of delegation<br>
          7. User data: client/server side encryption<br>

      "Always design your AWS environment for failure" - Anonymous<br>

      HA and FT: DynamoDB and Route53<br>
      HA only: EC2 and S3<br>
      Example: Your app needs 6 instances for stable performance, how do you achieve HA and FT?<br>

      3. Warm Standby: replicated production environment in another AZ/Region but at a lower capacity<br>

      <div class="col-6 content">
        Virtual computing environment (instances) that you can launch and manage from a GUI or from CLI code<br>
        Supports most OS (Windows, RedHat, SUSE, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux)<br>
        Instances are scalable and optimizable<br>
        Consider the following before you create: core count, memory size, storage size and type, network performance, and CPU architecture<br><br>

        <b>Pricing Models</b><br>
        1. On-demand: pay as you go compute resources. Low cost, flexible.<br>
        2. Spot instances: bidding on instances based on supply/demand, pay the price per instance-hour set at the start of each instance-hour for the entire hour (spot price).  Gives 2 minute prior notification before stopping an instance for someone with a higher bid.  Good for large scale, dynamic workloads.<br>
        3. Reserved instances: full upfront, partial upfront, and no upfront payment options for 1 and 3 	year contract durations.  Good to predict costs and know available capacity needed.<br>
        4. Dedicated Host: you rent the underlying hardware, single-tenancy model, pay hourly, can be upto 75% cheaper than on-demand.  You can control licensing. Good for compliance and regulatory requirements.<br><br>

        Per Second Billing: minimum increment is 60 seconds, so even if you run for 10 seconds, you will be charged for 60<br>
        Available for On-Demand, Reserved, Spot instances, all regions and AZs, only on Amazon Linux and Ubuntu.  Everything else is per-hour.<br><br>

        Reserved Instances are just a billing scheme. You can purchase at Region Level or at AZ level; regional level is better because if you buy an xlarge instance then you can run 2 large ones.<br>
        Also can do a "Scheduled" Reserve i.e. 1 year reserved, compute between 01:00 and 03:00.  Halfway towards serverless.  <br>
        You can re-sell your instances in the AWS marketplace if you don't need them anymore but the contract didn't expire. <br>
        And You can upgrade your reserved host model.<br><br>

        Spot instance hibernation: You can basically pause an EBS backed instance, resumed by the Spot service when your defined max price is less than the Spot price. <br>
        Crucial to have a hybernation agent and to have an encrypted Root volume.  <br>
        Instance memory is stored on the root volume when hybernated.<br><br>

        Enhanced Networking: currently supported using SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization). <br>
        SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization compared to traditional implementations.
        <br>For supported Amazon EC2 instances, this feature provides higher packet per second (PPS) performance, lower inter-instance latencies, and very low network jitter.
